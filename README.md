## Edit the font

You can easily add/remove radicals by managing the SVG files inside the `svg` folder. If you would like to add more radicals, you can easily create SVG files from a BMP with [potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/). The font used to render the radicals was `Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro` in bold.
